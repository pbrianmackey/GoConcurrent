#Docker

It's all about applications.  

Servers used to require 1:1 builds.  1 server for one app.  This requires tons of operational and capital expense.  Not to mention 10 weeks to deployment.

##Containers

A bit like a VM.  Containers are way more lightweight than VM's.  A container is a super lightweight OS. Every container shares a single common linux kernal in the host.

###Problems solved

- OS's do not have a good way of managing two different versions of the same file on the same system.
- Gives you unique individual user space
- Each container gets its own memory space
- Each container gets its own network space (IP Address)

This partitioning magic is performed via kernal namespaces. namespaces: pid, net, mnt, user.

cgroups let us group resources together and apply limits.  Max cpu, block io, etc

Docker supports capabilites which are important from a security perspective

##Business Use cases

Rent servers on demand rather than buy and underutilize.

##Hypervisor

In the Hypervisor model you have multiple apps running per physical server.  Each app gets its own dedicated VM.

##The good bits

- Docker allows you to spin up an application without an OS!!!!

Containers vs virtual machines.
